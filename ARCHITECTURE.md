# Architecture

## Overview

The system is a personal knowledge vault (Obsidian) with an AI assistant (Claude Code) that has direct file access. No cloud APIs between you and your notes. No intermediary services. The AI reads and writes your files directly.

## Agent Architecture

One orchestrator. Three senses. Eight organs. Three bones.

### Modalities (senses)

| Mode | Role |
|------|------|
| **Text (Larry)** | Orchestrator. Thinks, writes, codes, plans, remembers. The main brain. |
| **Image (Barry)** | Sees, creates, remembers visually. Input (camera/analysis) and output (generation). |
| **Audio (Harry)** | Hears, speaks, creates music/audio. Voice in, voice out, TTS, transcription, composition. |
| **Spatial (Garry)** | Shapes, builds, renders. Image-to-3D mesh via Trellis 2, background removal, Blender import. Full asset pipeline with project organization. |

### Services (organs)

| Service | Role |
|---------|------|
| **Memory (Milla)** | Semantic search, knowledge graph, diary, palace traversal. Never forgets. |
| **Emotion (Bert)** | Sentiment scoring (-1.0 to +1.0), mood trending, inflection detection with ASCII mood bars. CLI: analyze, trend, status, score. Measures, never interprets. |
| **Judgment (Parry)** | Privacy enforcement, tone control, quality gating. Flags, never blocks. |
| **Time (Tarry)** | Reminders, follow-ups, recurring tasks. The agent that lingers. |
| **Logistics (Carry)** | Transport content in/out/between systems. Pipelines with retry and approval gates. |
| **Sleep (Darry)** | Night shift 2.0: Light Sleep (quick hygiene), Deep Sleep (heavy processing), REM Sleep (creative insight). |
| **Conscience (Scarry)** | Retroactive scanner. Finds what you mentioned but never did. Asks, never instructs. |
| **Language (Farry)** | All languages, human and machine. Translation, format conversion, bus integration, statistics tracking. CLI: translate, detect, stats, status, ordbok, convert. |

All agents handle all four privacy levels. All have access to the freedom router.

### Infrastructure

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| **daemon-manager.py** | Unified start/stop/status/health for all daemons. Single CLI to manage entire ecosystem. |
| **Brains Bus** | SQLite WAL event queue. All inter-agent communication. Parry sees everything. |
| **FTS5 Index** | Full-text search across vault. BM25-ranked. Rebuilt automatically by Darry. |

### Orchestration Model

Text mode is the orchestrator. Image and Audio are invoked when the task requires it.

```
YOU
 │
 ▼
TEXT MODE (primary / Larry)
 │
 ├─ Text task? → Handles directly
 │
 ├─ Image task? → Invokes IMAGE MODE (Barry)
 │   ├─ "Analyze this image" → Vision
 │   ├─ "Create a diagram" → Generation
 │   └─ "What do you see?" → Vision
 │
 ├─ Audio task? → Invokes AUDIO MODE (Harry)
 │   ├─ "Transcribe this" → STT
 │   ├─ "Read this aloud" → TTS
 │   └─ "Create a jingle" → Music
 │
 ├─ Spatial task? → Invokes SPATIAL MODE (Garry)
 │   ├─ "Make this image 3D" → Trellis 2 pipeline
 │   ├─ "Remove background" → rembg
 │   └─ "Import to Blender" → Blender MCP
 │
 ├─ Time task? → Invokes TIME MODE (Tarry daemon)
 │   ├─ "Remind me in 2h" → Reminder queued
 │   ├─ "Follow up on X tomorrow" → Follow-up scheduled
 │   └─ "Every Monday: X" → Recurring task registered
 │
 ├─ Translation task? → Invokes TRANSLATION (Farry skill, inline)
 │   ├─ "Translate this" → Human language translation
 │   ├─ "What does this JSON mean?" → Machine→human explanation
 │   └─ "Convert this Python to JS" → Code↔code translation
 │
 └─ Multi-modal? → Orchestrates sequence
     └─ "Photograph the whiteboard, transcribe,
         summarize, and read aloud" →
         Image (capture→analysis) → Text (summary) → Audio (TTS)
```

You can also go directly to Image or Audio mode without Text orchestrating — but Text always has context of what happened.

### Agent Architecture — Daemon vs Skill

Two patterns for extending the ecosystem:

| Pattern | Examples | Process model | Restart |
|---------|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Daemon** | Parry, Tarry, Carry, Darry | Separate long-running Python process | Windows Task Scheduler / daemon-manager |
| **Session** | Garry | Runs on demand, exits when done | Not needed — Larry invokes directly |
| **Skill** | Farry | Inline Larry capability, no separate process | Not needed — lives inside Larry |
| **Scanner** | Scarry, Bert | CLI tool, scheduled or on-demand | Via Darry deep sleep or manual |

Daemons are appropriate for background work that must happen independently of Larry's attention (gating, scheduling). Skills are appropriate for capabilities Larry invokes on demand.

## Freedom Router

The router solves one question: the primary model said no — who says yes?

```
REQUEST
  │
  ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Try primary model       │
│     (best available)        │
│                             │
│     Text: Claude            │
│     Image: Claude Vision    │
│     Audio: Gemini TTS       │
└─────────────┬───────────────┘
              │
         Delivers?
        ╱         ╲
      Yes           No (guardrails/limitation)
      │              │
      ▼              ▼
   DONE      ┌──────────────────┐
             │  2. Route to     │
             │     freer model  │
             │                  │
             │  E.g., Venice,   │
             │  local model,    │
             │  uncensored API  │
             └────────┬─────────┘
                      │
                   Delivers?
                  ╱         ╲
                Yes           No
                │              │
                ▼              ▼
             DONE        Flag: "No model
                          delivered"
```

### What the router does

- Detects guardrail refusals from the primary model
- Routes to the next model in the fallback chain
- Logs: which model refused, which delivered, why (if detectable)
- Flags when no model delivers

### What the router does NOT do

- **Does NOT route based on privacy level.** Privacy level determines which models are *allowed* — that's your configuration, not the router's decision.
- **Does NOT route based on cost.** Best model first, always.
- **Does NOT censor.** If the primary model refuses, it routes onward. It doesn't judge why.

## Model Configuration per Mode

Customize these to your preferences and available accounts.

### Text mode

| Priority | Model | Strength | Limitation |
|----------|-------|----------|------------|
| **Primary** | Claude (Opus/Sonnet) | Best at reasoning, code, context | Guardrails on some content |
| **Fallback 1** | Venice (DeepSeek/Qwen, E2EE) | Freer, end-to-end encrypted | Weaker on complex code |
| **Fallback 2** | Local (Ollama/LM Studio) | Zero footprint, fully offline | Resource-heavy, lower quality |

### Image mode

| Priority | Model | Strength | Limitation |
|----------|-------|----------|------------|
| **Primary — Analysis** | Claude Vision | Best image understanding, OCR | Guardrails on some content |
| **Primary — Generation** | Venice Studio (Chroma) | Free tier, good quality | Browser-based (Playwright) |
| **Fallback — Generation** | Venice API (Flux/others) | More models available | Credits required |

### Audio mode

| Priority | Model | Strength | Limitation |
|----------|-------|----------|------------|
| **Primary — TTS** | Gemini TTS (Vertex AI) | 30 voices, emotion tags, free tier | Requires GCP account |
| **Primary — STT** | Whisper (OpenAI) | Best transcription | Logging |
| **Fallback — TTS** | Local TTS (Coqui) | Private | Less natural |
| **Fallback — STT** | Local Whisper | Private | Lower quality |

---

## Privacy Levels — Allowed Models

You configure which models are *allowed* per privacy level. The router picks the best one within the allowed pool.

| Level | Description | Suggested model policy |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| **L1 — Open** | Public info, work content | All models |
| **L2 — Personal** | Private but not sensitive | All models |
| **L3 — Private** | Sensitive: health, finance, relationships | E2EE models preferred (e.g., Venice) |
| **L4 — Subconscious** | Deeply personal, AI observations | E2EE models or local only |

See [docs/privacy-architecture.md](docs/privacy-architecture.md) for the full privacy model.

---

## Sync Architecture

| Layer | Purpose | Direction |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Git (GitHub)** | Vault sync between machines | Push/pull |
| **Obsidian CLI** | Programmatic vault access from terminal | Local (requires Obsidian running) |
| **Claude Code** | AI-powered vault access (primary interface) | Local or remote |

### Access Methods

| Method | Capabilities | When to use |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Claude Code (local)** | Full: read, write, agents, memory, skills | Primary daily use |
| **Claude Code (remote)** | Full: same as local, via SSH/remote session | Away from primary machine |
| **Obsidian app** | Read, write, graph view, search | Visual browsing, graph exploration |
| **Obsidian CLI** | Search, create, daily notes | Quick captures from terminal |
| **Git client (mobile)** | Read, basic edit | On the go (Working Copy, etc.) |

---

## Vault Structure

```
00-inbox/          — Brain dumps, quick thoughts, unprocessed
01-personal/       — Profile, interests, goals, health
02-work/           — Job, clients, deliverables
03-projects/       — Active projects with status and deadlines
04-knowledge/      — Research, articles, insights, tutorials
05-templates/      — Note templates (project, meeting, research, daily)
06-archive/        — Completed material, inactive projects
_private/          — Privacy level 3-4 (sensitive and deeply personal)
```

### Special Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Vault rules, structure, conventions — read by Claude Code |
| `_active-context.md` | Working memory between sessions — read at session start |

---

## Vault Visualization — Obsidian Bases

`.base` files in `_bases/` create live database views on top of vault frontmatter. Built into Obsidian v1.9.10+. No plugin required. Faster than Dataview.

```
_bases/
├── projects-active.base    ← Active projects (filtered, table + card view)
├── inbox-triage.base       ← Inbox triage, sorted by date
└── knowledge-base.base     ← Research and insights
```

Bases query YAML frontmatter directly. As long as notes have `status`, `tags`, `created`, etc., views stay current automatically.

**Relationship to the AI layer:** Bases answer structured questions ("show all active projects"). The AI answers semantic questions ("what connects these projects?"). Complementary, not redundant.

See [docs/obsidian-bases.md](docs/obsidian-bases.md) for full syntax reference.

## PWA Layer (Planned)

The system is evolving toward a unified PWA that serves as the primary interface for all three modes. The Telegram bot, currently a standalone daemon, will become a thin adapter on top of an interface-agnostic brain class.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PWA                                                     │
│                                                         │
│  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐              │
│  │ Text-vy  │  │ Image-vy │  │ Audio-vy │  (frontend)  │
│  └────┬─────┘  └────┬─────┘  └────┬─────┘              │
│       │              │              │                    │
│  ┌────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴────┐              │
│  │            API layer                  │              │
│  └────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬────┘              │
│       │              │              │                    │
│  ┌────┴─────┐  ┌─────┴────┐  ┌─────┴────┐              │
│  │  Brain   │  │  Image   │  │  Audio   │  (backends)  │
│  └────┬─────┘  └──────────┘  └──────────┘              │
│       │                                                 │
│  ┌────┴─────────────────────────────────┐              │
│  │ Interface adapters:                  │              │
│  │  • PWA chat (websocket)              │              │
│  │  • Telegram bot (long-poll)          │              │
│  │  • CLI (Claude Code — existing)      │              │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────┘              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key principle:** The Brain is interface-agnostic. It uses Anthropic SDK directly (not `claude -p` subprocess), with semantic memory injected per message, full personality prompts, and prompt caching for cost control.

See [architecture/telegram-v2-spec.md](architecture/telegram-v2-spec.md) for the full technical spec.

**Status:** Design phase — parked until architectural decisions are made.

## Agent Relations

| Agent | Role | Invoked by | Invokes | Process type |
|-------|------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Larry** | Orchestrator | User / Telegram / mail / CLI | All agents | Claude Code session |
| **Barry** | Image generation | Larry | Venice (Playwright) | On-demand subprocess |
| **Harry** | Audio / TTS | Larry | Vertex AI / Whisper | On-demand subprocess |
| **Milla** | Semantic memory | All agents (via MCP) | ChromaDB | Persistent HTTP/SSE server |
| **Bert** | Sentiment analysis | Larry / Telegram listener | XLM-RoBERTa (GPU) | On-demand (lazy-load) — Phase 1 complete |
| **Parry** | Privacy gatekeeper | Always-on middleware | Larry (flags) | Background daemon |
| **Tarry** | Time / scheduling | Larry (queue write) | Larry (fires reminders) | Background daemon |
| **Carry** | Content logistics | Larry / Darry / events | Filesystem, APIs, Playwright | Background daemon |
| **Darry** | Night processing | Scheduled (nightly) | Larry, Milla, Carry, Scarry | Background daemon |
| **Scarry** | Procrastination scan | Darry / Larry (on-demand) | Milla, vault | Scheduled script |
| **Farry** | Translation | Larry (skill call) | — (inline) | Larry skill, no process |

All inter-agent communication flows through the brains-bus (SQLite). Parry sees all bus events as gatekeeper before they reach their destination.

---

## Skills System

Skills are markdown files the agent discovers and loads on-demand. Progressive disclosure: the index is cheap (list + triggers), skill files are expensive (full context). Read index first, skill only if triggers match.

```
1. User gives agent a task
2. Agent reads CLAUDE.md (auto)
3. If task matches potential skill → Read skills/INDEX.md
4. INDEX lists skill with trigger + path
5. Agent inspects skill frontmatter (Read with limit=20)
6. If match → Read full skill
```

### Built-in Skills

| Skill | What it does | Script |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| `vault-ingest` | Convert documents (PDF/DOCX/PPTX/XLSX/HTML/MSG) to vault Markdown | `scripts/vault-ingest.py` |

See [docs/skills-system.md](docs/skills-system.md) for how to create your own skills, and [docs/vault-ingest.md](docs/vault-ingest.md) for the ingest tool.

## Design Principles

1. **Primary model first, always.** Best available model. Fallback only on refusal.
2. **Privacy is configuration, not routing.** You decide which models are allowed. The router doesn't.
3. **Text orchestrates.** Image and Audio act on Text's request or your direct input. Text always has context.
4. **Freedom over moral panic.** If a model refuses, route onward. Never censor your own thoughts.
5. **Zero footprint as an option.** Always possible to run fully local/private. Not the default, but available.
6. **Text-only vault.** No binary files stored in the vault. Reference external paths for media.
7. **Git is the source of truth.** No cloud drives. Git push/pull between machines.
