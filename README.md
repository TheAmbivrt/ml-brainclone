# Larry Scaffold

A scaffold for building a personal AI second brain using **Claude Code** and **Obsidian**.

Larry is an AI-powered personal knowledge system that combines an Obsidian vault with Claude Code as the primary interface, plus specialized agents for image generation, audio/TTS, and privacy enforcement. Everything runs locally on your machine.

## The Four Agents

| Agent | Modality | What it does | Technology |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Larry** | Text | Orchestrator. Thinks, writes, codes, plans, remembers. | Claude Code (Opus/Sonnet) |
| **Barry** | Image | Generates images, sorts visual material, maintains visual index. | Venice Chat via Playwright |
| **Harry** | Audio | Text-to-speech, music, sound effects, mixing. | Gemini TTS (Vertex AI) + FFmpeg |
| **Parry** | Filter | Privacy enforcement, tone control, quality gating. | Python middleware |

Larry orchestrates everything. Barry and Harry are invoked by Larry when needed. Parry runs as middleware on commits, sends, and generation.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Text-only vault** — No binary files (images, audio) in the vault. External storage only. The vault is pure markdown.
- **Git sync** — The vault syncs via Git (private GitHub repo). No cloud drive dependencies.
- **Privacy layers** — Four levels (L1 public through L4 deeply personal), enforced by code.
- **Best model first** — Always use the best available model. Fall back to freer models only on guardrail refusal.
- **Robust over quick** — Never a hack. The system must be reliable enough to trust as your second brain.
- **Yolo mode** — Larry runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. No confirmation prompts.
- **Nightly automation** — Scheduled tasks run overnight (Claude Haiku): vault hygiene, inbox triage, knowledge distillation.

## Prerequisites

| Component | Required? | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | Yes | Claude Max subscription or API access |
| **Obsidian** (v1.12.4+) | Yes | Vault editor with CLI support |
| **Git** + GitHub | Yes | Vault sync (private repo recommended) |
| **Python 3.10+** | Yes | Agent scripts |
| **For MemPalace:** NVIDIA GPU (CUDA) | Recommended | Semantic memory layer (works on CPU too) |
| **For Barry:** Venice.ai account, Edge, Playwright | Optional | Image generation agent |
| **For Harry:** GCP + Vertex AI, FFmpeg | Optional | Audio/TTS agent |

## Quick Start

1. **Create your vault** and init a Git repo:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/my-vault && cd ~/my-vault
   git init
   mkdir -p {00-inbox,01-personal,02-work,03-projects,04-knowledge,05-templates,06-archive,_private}
   ```

2. **Copy `CLAUDE-template.md`** into your vault root as `CLAUDE.md` and fill in the `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values.

3. **Copy templates** from `templates/` into `05-templates/`.

4. **Copy scripts** from `scripts/` and configure the hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`.

5. **Start Larry**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/my-vault
   claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
   ```

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for the full step-by-step guide.

## Placeholders

Throughout all files, replace these with your own values:

| Placeholder | Replace with |
|-------------|--------------|
| `{{USERNAME}}` | Your name or handle |
| `{{VAULT_PATH}}` | Path to your Obsidian vault |
| `{{ASSETS_PATH}}` | Path to your image/media assets |
| `{{AUDIO_PATH}}` | Path to your audio output |
| `{{GITHUB_REPO}}` | Your GitHub repo (e.g. `you/my-vault`) |
| `{{GCP_PROJECT}}` | Your Google Cloud project ID (for Harry TTS) |
| `{{NAS_PATH}}` | Your NAS/backup mount point |
| `{{VAULT_SLUG}}` | Claude Code project slug (e.g. `Users--you--vault`) |
| `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` | Your project/vault name |
